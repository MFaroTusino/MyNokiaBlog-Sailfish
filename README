                         *****Wordpress-viewer*****

This is an open-source project that is designed to access your wordpress content, via a JSON plugin.

The project uses Qt to display and search for articles, as well as view and post comments. This *should* work on virtually any wordpress-based site (self-hosted or not), as long as the JSON plugin linked in this post is installed to your chosen site.

The current project is built using Sailfish Silica Components, but, Qt being extremely flexible, can see this run on any Qt-supported platform, with minor changes to the QML files (and platfrom specific package dependencies).

Currently maintained by Michael Faro-Tusino (MFaroTusino) and Lucien Xu (SfietKonstantin)
